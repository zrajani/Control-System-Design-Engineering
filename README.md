# Control-System-Design-Engineering

Different Concepts of Control System Design Engineering such as Root locus, Block Daigram reduction, Transfer Function Representation Using MATLAB and Simulink 

The concepts of control system engineering is done using the built in function in matlab software.

Software version used: MATLAB R2013b

Working still to avaoid using the built in function and create our own algorithms for the concepts of the control system engineering. 
Also will start illustrating the concepts and usage of simulink software.
