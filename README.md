# Control-System-Design-Engineering

Design of control system is useful in designing application for automatic system such as robot design, robust control

Different Concepts of Control System Design Engineering such as Root locus, Block Daigram reduction, Transfer Function Representation Using MATLAB and Simulink 

The concepts of control system engineering is done using the built in function in matlab software.

The following concepts are illustrated in this repository:
1. Block Daigram Reduction Techniques
2. Illustration of Bode Plot
3. Plotting Bode Plot (Zeros and poles of a function)
4. Finding Response to a system depending on the output of the system
5. Second Order System in Control Systems
6. Polar Plots in Control System

### Each Folder in the Repository will contain:
1. Program (MATLAB CODE)
2. Output File 
3. Readme file containing output figure for immediate view

Software version used: MATLAB R2013b

Working still to avaoid using the built in function and create our own algorithms for the concepts of the control system engineering. 
Also will start illustrating the concepts and usage of simulink software.
